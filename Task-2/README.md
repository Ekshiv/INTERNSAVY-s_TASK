# 🛍️ Mall Customers Clustering Analysis 🛍️

Welcome to the Mall Customers Clustering Analysis project! 🎉

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform a clustering analysis on the Mall Customers dataset to identify distinct customer segments based on their spending behavior and annual income. We use three different clustering techniques: K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering, to gain insights into customer groups and understand their characteristics.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Data Exploration

We started with data exploration to understand the distribution of numerical features (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score). We also visualized relationships between pairs of features and calculated correlations between them.

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing

We handled any missing values, encoded categorical features (Genre), and scaled numerical features (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score) for clustering.

## K-Means Clustering

- Briefly explain the K-Means algorithm.
- Found the optimal value of K using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
- Built the K-Means model with the chosen K.
- Performed clustering on the dataset and obtained cluster labels.
- Visualized the clusters using scatter plots and evaluated performance using Inertia and Silhouette Score.

## DBSCAN Clustering

- Briefly explain the DBSCAN algorithm.
- Tuned hyperparameters (eps and min_samples).
- Built the DBSCAN model with the chosen hyperparameters.
- Performed clustering on the dataset and obtained cluster labels.
- Visualized the clusters using scatter plots and identified outliers.

## Hierarchical Clustering

- Briefly explain the Hierarchical Clustering algorithm.
- Chose a linkage method (Ward) based on the dataset.
- Built the Hierarchical Clustering model.
- Visualized the dendrogram to determine the optimal number of clusters (5).
- Performed clustering and visualized the clusters using scatter plots.

## Conclusion

Summarized the findings and insights from the clustering analysis.
Discussed the effectiveness and limitations of each clustering technique.
Provided actionable recommendations based on the clustering results.
Suggested potential areas for further exploration or improvement.
